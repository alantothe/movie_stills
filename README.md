## Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, you'll need to clone and run the backend server first, then run this frontend (Next.js) client. Client code is expecting the server on http://localhost:8081/

1. This project depends on a backend server which can be found here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alantothe/movies_server.git
```

2. Once the backend is running, follow these steps to start the client:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/alantothe/movie_stills.git

# cd
cd movie_stills

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
